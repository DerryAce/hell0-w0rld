Initializing Transmission

Hi ya,
My name is DerryAce #TheMadScientist I love to experiment with stuff, mostly computers. 
I have over the years taught myself how to code and develop in php and in my spare time I like to 
design things in Photoshop and make motion graphics in After Effects I'm an Adobe Creative.

So stick around for some crazy inventions made out of nothing but sheer imagination.
